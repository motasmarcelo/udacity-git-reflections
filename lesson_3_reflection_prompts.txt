1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A1: To share with others and/or backup

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A2: Because maybe i'm just trying new features or working on an version that i dont want to be
updated

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
branches - parallels versions of files in a repository. Testing and experimentals localy
clone - copy of one entire repository. Copy a repository of interest
fork - clone operation inside GitHub's enviroment. Copy a repository to am from github

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A4: Allow to track the remote state to updates the commits apropriately.

5) How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A5: Maybe across email messages or a web file sharing service. It was easy needing no setup accounts and so but
the version control itself would be harder to track.

6) When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?
A6: When im testing new features or fixing a bug. Impacts on maintenance, if its a simple change/project that i can 
broke and easy repair or if its a complex project/colaborate/implementation im about to make.
