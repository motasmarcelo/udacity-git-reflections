1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A1: To share with others and/or backup

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A2: Because maybe i'm just trying new features or working on an version that i dont want to be
updated
